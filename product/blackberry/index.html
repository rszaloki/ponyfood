We like them fully yellow with just a dusting of brown freckles. But super-ripe, meltingly sweet bananas and firmer greenish ones have their fans too. Slice them onto cereal or pancakes, fold into fruit salad, blend into smoothies, and bake into muffins. Heat brings out bananas' creamy sweetness. Try baking, broiling, or sautéing them with butter and sugar for a luscious dessert.",category:"fruit"},{id:"blackberry",name:"Blackberries",description:"These plump berries burst with sweet dark lusciousness. Each bite-sized berry creates a mini-explosion of flavor on the tongue. These beauties make a very tasty pie — especially with apples in the English style. They are scrumptious pureed in a dessert sauce or scattered over waffles.",category:"fruit"},{id:"carrot",name:"Rainbow Carrots",description:"Colorful, crunchy and very sweet! These multi-colored carrots are lovely to look at and even lovelier to snack on. We suggest enjoying them raw, either as part of a festive crudité platter or shredded in a salad. If you must cook them, do it quickly — their colors fade the longer you cook them.",category:"vegetable"},{id:"cepe",name:"Dried Cepe Mushrooms",description:"They're called cèpes in France and porcinis in Italy, but you might just call them delicious. This meaty mushroom comes dried, but it's easy to use (just boil water and soak mushrooms for 20 minutes to reconstitute), and simple to store. Cèpes are particularly good in pasta dishes and omelettes and work well with garlic and fresh flat-leaf parsley or thyme. Don't throw out the soaking water — it's delicious in risotto or soup.",category:"mushroom"},{id:"cherry",name:"Red Cherry",description:"We dare you to eat just one of these irresistible sweet-tart fruits. Their shine and juiciness work hand in hand to keep you dipping into the fruit bowl until they're all gone. For a change of pace from cobblers and pie, try them with game and in rich sauces.",category:"fruit"},{id:"cucumber",name:"Greenhouse Cucumber",description:'A truly super cuke. Hothouse cucumbers are green, fresh-tasting, and almost minty. At least a foot long and seedless, they are sometimes called "burpless" because their thin skins are easy to digest. They make the most refined teatime sandwiches.',category:"vegetable"},{id:"eggplant",name:"Eggplant",description:"Lush and creamy, with a mild, earthy flavor, eggplant has the most velvety texture in the vegetable family. It's high in healthy fiber. We love it sliced, brushed with olive oil and salt, and grilled or roasted. We also love it breaded, fried, and smothered in fried onions. Come to think of it, we just plain love it.",category:"vegetable"},{id:"grape",name:"Red Seedless Grape",description:"Mother Nature's ruby-colored candy. Seedless, juicy, and sweet. An easy addition to green salads with nuts and crunchy vegetables. Grapes contain the antioxidant resveratrol and immune-boosting phytochemicals.",category:"fruit"},{id:"maitake",name:"Maitake Mushroom",description:'Due to its frilly frond–like growths resembling the fluffed feathers of a chicken, the intriguing maitake mushroom is affectionately known by fungi aficionados as the "hen of the woods." It\'s most commonly found growing wild in the Northeast and Mid–Atlantic states, particularly favoring the base of oak trees where a single bloom can grow to weigh anywhere between 5–100 pounds. Boasting a deeply rich umami flavor, maitake is great grilled, roasted, or sautéed with oil, salt, and pepper, and is done when crisp around the edges but tender and meaty inside. We love it on pizza or in pasta dishes.',category:"mushroom"},{id:"morel",name:"Dried Morel Mushrooms",description:"TBecause they grow in forests and must be wild-gathered, the morel is a coveted delicacy in the spring and fall. These dried versions provide their distinctively wild flavor to meats, game, egg dishes and cream sauces, and they store for months — making them a convenient, year-round alternative to fresh morels.",category:"mushroom"},{id:"onion",name:"Yellow Onion",description:"You just can't cook without 'em. Use yellow onions whenever a recipe simply calls for \"onion.\" Ours have exceptional sweetness. They are guaranteed to bring out all the flavor in any ingredient you cook them with.",category:"vegetable"},{id:"pepper",name:"Rainbow Pepper",description:"For a burst of beautiful color and mildly sweet crunch, look no further than this rainbow pepper pack. We love adding this colorful collection of bell peppers to salad, soup and stir-fry. They're also super tasty raw and make pulling together a last-minute crudité platter a snap! Use small bell peppers for chopping and dicing. Large bell peppers work best for stuffing, roasting and slicing.",category:"vegetable"},{id:"porcini",name:"Dried Porcini Mushrooms",description:"Porcinis are called cèpes in France and are sometimes known as boletes — their scientific name. These extra-fancy porcinis are picked from the mountains and thinly sliced, though they hold their shape well when cooked. Particularly good in Italian and French cuisines, you'll find these mushrooms rehydrate well for use with pastas, risottos, soups, stews and stuffings. They also store for months — making them a convenient ingredient for last-minute meals.",category:"mushroom"}]},serverRendered:!0}</script><script type="text/javascript" defer src="/ponyfood/_nuxt/manifest.cc1cb12f7c642ebb0632.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" defer src="/ponyfood/_nuxt/vendor.bundle.cc1cb12f7c642ebb0632.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" defer src="/ponyfood/_nuxt/nuxt.bundle.2fdf4be1e352b2dec461.js"></script>
